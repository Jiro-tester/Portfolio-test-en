# Manual Testing Portfolio

Welcome to my manual testing project portfolio.

This repository contains a series of exercises designed to demonstrate my skills in manual software testing.  
Each exercise follows a clear structure: test plan, test cases, and bug report.

## Goals

- Professionally structure manual tests
- Write clear and precise test cases
- Identify and document bugs
- Apply ISTQB best practices

## Structure

Each folder corresponds to an exercise:
exercise-01-contact-form/
├── test-plan.md
├── test-cases.md
└── bug-report.md
